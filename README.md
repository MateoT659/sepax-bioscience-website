# Sepax Bioscience GoDaddy Tags
This repo contains all of the code that is used in the GoDaddy website. Each file corresponds to one HTML section in the code, and should have a documentation comment at the top that shows where in the website it is, and what it does. It should have the form:

```
'''
GoDaddy Page and Location

DESCRIPTION:
Description of what the page does.

MAINTANANCE:
Description of how to maintain the page (i.e., how do you add a new product? What actions could cause this page to fail?)

'''
```

Also, please use a lot of comments so people know what's going on in each HTML tag!
